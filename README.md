# SQL-Access-World-Database

Welcome to my project repository where I explore the "world" public database using SQL and Microsoft Access.

## About the Database

The "world" database contains information about cities, countries and country languages. It provides valuable information about city and country names, population, region, area, life expectancy, gnp, government, head of state, language spoken.

## Tools Used

- SQL
- Microsoft Access

## Project Overview

The project aims to demonstrate knowledge of various tools that can be used while working with a database. In this instance, I chose to start with Access because it provides an intuitive system for visualizing the database structure. I then migrated the database to MySQL to perform queries and showcase proficiency in fundamental functionalities and formulas.

## Functions in Detail

### Database Exploration with Microsoft Access:
- Used Microsoft Access to explain the relational model and provide theoretical insights into databases.
- Viewed tables, established relationships, and grasped data distribution in the project.

### SQL Query Execution:
- Wrote and executed SQL queries to interact with the database.
- Utilized various SQL clauses, including COUNT (to tally rows), AND (to combine conditions), ORDER BY (to sort results), WHERE (to filter data based on conditions), and LIMIT (to control the number of rows returned).
- Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using MySQL to visualize the database structure and identify primary keys, foreign keys and composite keys.
  
### Utilizing JOIN for Complex Queries:
- Exploited the JOIN function extensively.
- Merged related rows between tables to obtain intricate and meaningful results.
- Applied INNER JOIN for matching rows in all three tables and LEFT JOIN to include all rows from one table along with matches from another.

## Repository Structure
