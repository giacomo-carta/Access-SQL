# SQL-Access-World-Database

Welcome to my project repository where I explore the "world" public database using SQL and Microsoft Access.

## About the Database

The "world" database contains information about cities, countries and country languages. It provides valuable information about city and country names, population, region, area, life expectancy, gnp, government, head of state, language spoken.

## Tools Used

- SQL
- Microsoft Access

### Functions in detail

In this project, I firstly used Microsoft Access to analyse the relational structure of the database. 
I then used SQL queries to retrieve information with functions such as COUNT, AND, ORDER BY, WHERE, LIMIT and more.
As the database consisted in 3 tables, I used the JOIN function create meaningful queries.
